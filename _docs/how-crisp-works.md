How Crisp works
===============

Our second A3 is called "Crisp strategy" but it's really more about how we operate:

![Crisp Strategy A3](../assets/CrispStrategyA3-sv.jpg "Crisp Strategy A3")

It hangs on the wall next to the [What is Crisp](what-is-crisp.html) A3. Here's an [english translation](../assets/CrispStrategyA3-en.pdf) of the pic. Summarized below:

What do we measure?
-------------------

We measure:

-   How happy we are (see [Happiness Index](happiness-index.html))
-   How happy our customers are. (actually, this point is partly aspirational. Currently our only systematic customer satisfaction metric is [Net Promoter Score](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter) for course participants).

How many do we want to be?
--------------------------

-   We don't have a growth target. Growth is not a goal in itself.
-   We grow only when we find awesome people and aren't suffering from growth pain.

For more see [Recruiting](recruiting.html).

How do we run the company?
--------------------------

-   **Lean & Agile** - our approach is based on lean and [agile](http://agilemanifesto.org) principles.
-   **Meritocracy & Consensus** - we don't have titles, managers, or reporting structures. Instead we are a [meritocracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy), which basically means your power to influence stuff is based on your competence and engagement. Decisions are made mostly using consensus ([here's how](decisions.html)).
-   **Ask for forgiveness rather than permission** - if you want to start or change something, go ahead! The default answer to any request or idea is "Sure! If you believe in it and want to put time into it!". Very few mistakes are fatal or irreversible, so we encourage each other to just try things rather than seek permission.
-   **Simple models** - being a bunch of smart engineers and process nerds, we can come up with detailed rules and structures for any kind problem. But we really try not to! We don't want to overcomplicate things, and prefer to err on the side of simplicity. Better to have too few rules than too many, and better to follow high level guiding principles than low level detailed procedures.

For more info, see [How we make decisions](decisions.html).

How do we differentiate?
------------------------

How are we different from a typical consulting company?

-   Crisp is not trying to earn money from its consultants
-   100% freedom for all consultants (as long as they don't hurt the home)
-   Crisp has no other goal than to provide a happy home

How are we different from a typical network of independents?

-   We are dedicated to Crisp - that is, consultants are expected to do all their work and invoicing through Crisp.

Why does this strategy work?
----------------------------

Although this is part of the A3, it's really a separate topic: [Why this model works](why-this-works.html)
